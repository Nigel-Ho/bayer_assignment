Additional safety data from maintenance study period CT-P10 3.3 and follow-up period should be provided (see RMP).	Negative
Most common reported events were infections, infusion related reactions.	Neutral
More detailed data on injection site reactions, hypersensitivity and anaphylactic reactions were requested in order to allow a thorough assessment of this issue both in subjects with and without ADAs.	Negative
The effect was consistent across studies and across investigated subgroups.	Neutral
The efficacy data of the two phase 3 placebo-controlled studies in patients who received background DMARDs showed that both dose regimens of sarilumab (150 mg q2w, 200 mg q2w) were superior to placebo regarding improvement of signs and symptoms (ACR20 responses), of physical function (change from baseline in HAQ-DI) and of progression in structural damage (mTSS, only study EFC11072).	Positive
The objectives of study CT-P10 3.3 were to demonstrate similarity in pharmacokinetics and non-inferiority in efficacy of CT-P10 to Rituxan as primary endpoints when coadministered with CVP in patients with advanced FL; these objectives have been met and furthermore, extrapolation in the context of NHL and CLL indications is acceptable.	Positive
The median OS time in the updated results exceeded 1 year	Neutral
The clinical safety sections of the SmPC contain appropriate information for each substance and reflect the safety information on the FDC.	Positive
Thus it appears plausible that the effect can be maintained for a majority of patients at the doses	Positive
Treatment-emergent AIA did not affect efficacy or safety endpoints in either T1DM or T2DM subjects.	Positive
Both studies, demonstrated that SAR342434 is non-inferior to Humalog in improvement of glycaemic control by Week 26 and therefore provided strong supportive evidence about the comparability/ biosimilarity of the two products.	Positive
No major concerns have been identified in the updated analysis	Positive
Therefore, the available safety data are considered supportive of biosimilarity between CT-P10 and MabThera.	Positive
However, further analyses have shown that only a small proportion of patients (7% and 15%, study EFC12404 and EFC12405 respectively) had both reached the maximum dose and were in need of intensified treatment at week 30	Positive
The 12-month results of study EFC12619 further supported similar clinical efficacy of SAR342434 and Humalog in T1DM subjects.	Positive
Results from the pivotal study CLARITY showed a clinically relevant effect of cladribine in patients with RMS in terms of reduction of relapse rate as well as MRI lesions and delay in disability progression.	Positive
The results of study 084-09 with 100mg formulation can be extrapolated to other strengths 20mg, according to conditions in the Guidelines.	Positive
A similar trend towards prolonged OS was also observed in favour of lenvatinib monotherapy but less obvious than with combination therapy.	Positive
to the EMA Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev. 1/ Corr **), Ivabradine 5 mg film-coated tablets satisfy the conditions for waiver of bioequivalence studies conducted on the applied product 7.5 mg strength.	Positive
Other potentially related AE’s including decreased appetite, vomiting, muscle spasms and rash.	Neutral
In conclusion, the safety profile of Insulin lispro Sanofi is acceptable and not different to that of Humalog.	Positive
The frequencies and nature of the adverse events were in line with those reported for the innovator MabThera/Rituxan in the RA and NLH study populations.	Positive
The main side effects that have been observed with CHF 5993 are associated with the known ICS, LAMA and LABA effects.	Neutral
With regard to immunogenicity, the incidence and titre distribution of ADAs were compared and seemed similar for SB5 and Humira, with about half of all subjects developing neutralising antibodies in each treatment group.	Positive
SOF/VEL/VOX for 12 weeks has shown excellent efficacy in patients that have previously failed a regimen containing an NS5A inhibitor.	Positive
In addition, the fatality rate in nusinersen-treated subjects with infantile-onset SMA was about half that of sham-controlled subjects	Positive
However, these results are not seen for DAS28 which is favourable, or for ACR50 or ACR70, and as such it is concluded, that the difference seen at week 2 in ACR20 is likely to be a chance finding rather than a true difference.	Positive
Only 3 pivotal randomized double-blind multicentre placebo controlled studies (Parsons and Mulholland 1987, Mulholland et al 1990 and Parsons et al 1993) among the 6 pivotal studies met their primary endpoint “GRA” and some secondary endpoints such as pain.	Negative
Sarilumab is associated with infections (including serious infections), decrease in ANC and platelet count, and increase in ALT and lipids, all of which are events consistent with the known effect of IL-6 inhibition, and with injection site reactions, consistent with a SC route of administration.	Neutral
The frequencies and nature of the adverse events were in line with those reported for the innovator MabThera/Rituxan in the RA and NLH study populations.	Positive
Based on the presented bioequivalence study the test formulation Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka d.d. 200mg/245mg film coated tablets of Krka d.d. Slovenia is considered bioequivalent with the reference Truvada 200mg/245mg film coated tablets manufactured by Gilead Sciences Intl. Ltd. Ireland MA holder: Gilead Sciences UK.	Positive
This is in accordance with the relevant guideline and additional clinical studies were not considered necessary.	Positive
A similar 12 week course appears somewhat better than SOF/VEL in patients with previous failure on a DAA-containing regimen without an NS5A inhibitor.	Positive
No new safety signal has been reported.	Positive
The final results of the study should be submitted by 30th January 2020	Neutral
Furthermore, encouraging signs of a prolonged OS were seen in patients treated with the combination of lenvatinib and everolimus combination therapy as per the primary analysis as well as the two updated analyses that span a more than 1-year period.	Positive
Long-term safety data will be obtained from the planned and ongoing studies.	Neutral
A single dose bioequivalence study was considered sufficient since the application concerns an immediate release formulation.	Positive
• PASS: German real-world cohort study should be submitted as additional PhV activity to address the missing information of safety and efficacy in immune compromised patients	Negative
Therefore, the available safety data are considered supportive of biosimilarity between CT-P10 and MabThera.	Positive
This was supported by favourable safety and efficacy data from the interim analysis of a randomized controlled clinical study, CS4 in later-onset subjects, open-label studies in pre-symptomatic subjects, and subjects with infantile-onset and later-onset SMA, where the attainment of motor milestones in subjects receiving treatment differed from that seen in the natural history of SMA	Positive
In the studies, the FRC was always to be taken before breakfast, whereas the proposed SmPC states that Suliqua can be taken prior to any meal.	Neutral
The application contains an adequate review of published clinical data and the bioequivalence has been shown between Granpidam and Viagra® 100 mg film-coated tablets.	Positive
An 8 week course of SOF/VEL/VOX was similarly efficacious as 12 weeks of SOF/VEL in a difficult to cure DAA-naïve cirrhotic GT3 cohort.	Positive
